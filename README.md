# XNAT OpenID Connect Authentication Provider Plugin #

Tested with [Google's OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect "Google OpenID Connect") and [AAF](https://aaf.edu.au/ "AAF")

## Pre-requisities ##

This plugin requires updates in the XDAT and Xnat-web code, using the tagged version `1.7.5-auth-B3-SNAPSHOT`.

There are 2 ways to deploy XNAT-Web:

### - Download the pre-built WAR file from the XNAT Team ###

For convenience, you can [download the pre-built WAR file here](https://ci.xnat.org/job/auth-provider-refactor/job/XNAT%20Web/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/xnat-web-1.7.5-auth-B3-SNAPSHOT.war).

### - Build the code and generate a WAR file ###

1. Clone the [XDAT project](https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/xdat), then checkout the **1.7-auth-perf** branch: `git checkout 1.7-auth-perf`

1. Build the project using the instructions provided.

1. Clone the [XNAT-web project](https://bitbucket.org/qcifltd/xnat-web), then checkout the **1.7-auth-perf** branch: `git checkout 1.7-auth-perf`.

1. Build the project using the instructions provided or simply `./gradlew clean war`

1. Deploy the resulting war file at `build/libs/` into your Tomcat application.

## Deploying this plugin ##

When you have deployed the specific version of XNAT Web, you will need to deploy this XNAT plugin. For more information, please [XNAT documentation on how to deploy plugins.](https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation/xnat-administration/deploying-plugins-in-xnat)

Again there are 2 ways to accomplish this:

### 1. Download the pre-built JAR ###

1. Download the latest development version [here](http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=au.edu.qcif.xnat.openid&a=openid-auth-plugin&v=LATEST&e=jar)

1. Copy the plugin jar to your plugins folder:
    `cp build/libs/xnat-openid-auth-plugin-all-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /data/xnat/home/plugins`

1. Copy [Spring Security OAuth2](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/2.2.1.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-2.2.1.RELEASE.jar) and [Spring JWT library](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/spring-security-jwt/1.0.8.RELEASE/spring-security-jwt-1.0.8.RELEASE.jar) into the plugins directory:

  ```
  $ wget http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/2.2.1.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-2.2.1.RELEASE.jar
  $ wget http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/spring-security-jwt/1.0.8.RELEASE/spring-security-jwt-1.0.8.RELEASE.jar
  ```

  **Note:** These dependencies will be included in later development versions of **xnat-web** as well as the 1.7.5 release. Check the war file you downloaded and, if these libraries are already in the war file, you don't need to download them separately. You can check for them with the following command:

  ```
  $ jar tf xnat-web-1.7-auth-B3-SNAPSHOT.war | grep -E '(spring-security-oauth2|spring-security-jwt)'
  WEB-INF/lib/spring-security-oauth2-2.2.1.RELEASE.jar
  WEB-INF/lib/spring-security-jwt-1.0.8.RELEASE.jar
  ```

### 2. Build the code and generate the JAR ###

To build the XNAT OpenID authentication provider plugin:

1. If you haven't already, clone [this repository](https://github.com/qcif/xnat-openid-auth-plugin.git) and cd to the newly cloned folder.

1. Build the plugin:

    `./gradlew clean fatJar`

    On Windows, you can use the batch file:

    `gradlew.bat clean fatJar`

  This should build the plugin in the file **build/libs/xnat-openid-auth-plugin-all-_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT_.jar** (the version may differ based on updates to the code).

1. Build the plugin jar or download the latest development version [here](http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=au.edu.qcif.xnat.openid&a=openid-auth-plugin&v=LATEST&e=jar)

1. Copy the plugin jar to your plugins folder:

    `cp build/libs/xnat-openid-auth-plugin-all-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /data/xnat/home/plugins`

1. Copy [Spring Security OAuth2](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/oauth/spring-security-oauth2/2.2.1.RELEASE/spring-security-oauth2-2.2.1.RELEASE.jar) and [Spring JWT library](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/security/spring-security-jwt/1.0.8.RELEASE/spring-security-jwt-1.0.8.RELEASE.jar) into the plugins directory. See the **Note** above
about whether this step is necessary.


## Configuring and Testing ##

After deploying the plugin, you will need to configure it.

XNAT searches for authentication plugin configurations by looking for files whose names match the pattern:

    *-provider.properties

It looks in the following locations:

* On the classpath in the folder **META-INF/xnat/auth**
* In a folder named **auth** under the XNAT home folder (usually configured with the **xnat.home** system variable)

This plugin will use any entries located in any of those properties files where the property **type** is set to "openid". See the sample properties in the resources directory.

The following properties control the plugin:

### enabled
Comma delimited list of provide ids, currently tested with Google `google` and AAF `aaf`.

### openid.`providerId`.clientId
The ID obtained on app registration

### openid.`providerId`.clientSecret
The Secret obtained on app registration

### openid.`providerId`.scopes
Controls the scopes returned by the server: `openid,profile,email`

### openid.`providerId`.link
Controls the link HTML snippet displayed on the Login page for this provider. Location of the link text can optionally be customised by modifying `Login.vm`.

### openid.`providerId`.shouldFilterEmailDomains
Controls whether domains of the email should be compared against the whitelist: `allowedEmailDomains`.

### openid.`providerId`.allowedEmailDomains
Comma delimted whitelist of domains.

### openid.`providerId`.forceUserCreate
Allows skipping of user creation, usually set to true.

### openid.`providerId`.userAutoEnabled
Flag to set the `enabled` property of new users, set to false to allow admins to manually enable users before allowing logins, set to true to allow immediate access.

### openid.`providerId`.userAutoVerified
Flag to set the `verified` property of new users.

### openid.`providerId`.*Property
The property names used to populate user information during user creation. These are the property names from the information returned from the authentication provider.

### disableUsernamePasswordLogin
Toggle username & password login visibility on the login form

## Sample Configuration ##
